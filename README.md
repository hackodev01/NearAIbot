# NearAIbot- ENCODE X NEAR HORIZON 2023


## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating this AI chatbot for Web3-related tasks came from the growing popularity of blockchain technology and the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Building an AI chatbot that can connect to users' wallets and provide real-time information about their balances and transactions can greatly enhance the user experience and promote wider adoption of Web3 applications.

## What it does
The AI chatbot serves as a user-friendly interface for interacting with the NEAR Protocol blockchain. Users can connect their wallets securely to the chatbot and perform various tasks, such as checking their balance and viewing recent transactions.

## How we built it
The AI chatbot was built using a combination of technologies:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): We leveraged NLP models, like OpenAI's GPT-3.5, to enable seamless and human-like communication between the chatbot and users.

Web3 Integration: We integrated relevant Web3 libraries and APIs to interact with the NEAR Protocol blockchain securely.

## FUTURE GOALS 

What's next for AI Chatbot
In the future, we plan to enhance the chatbot's capabilities by adding more features and integrating with additional blockchain networks. Some potential developments include multi-platform support, handling advanced queries, and adding portfolio management features. Our vision is to continue refining the AI chatbot's capabilities and fostering broader adoption of blockchain technology.
